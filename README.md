Thank you, Infamous.

You Need to set the following variable on any vehicle that you want to have a radio for it to work properly!

_vehicle setVariable ["life_radioIsOn", false, true];


Version 2 Is local, and music is not synced, however all players inside vehicle while the radio is on will hear music (IMO THIS VERSION IS BORING!!!!!!)

Version 3, Uses 3D Audio, Is not local, Music is synced between all players, can be heard form a max of 15 meters away, Current track will finish if a players gets out of the car. (THIS VERSION IS THE POG ONE!!!)
